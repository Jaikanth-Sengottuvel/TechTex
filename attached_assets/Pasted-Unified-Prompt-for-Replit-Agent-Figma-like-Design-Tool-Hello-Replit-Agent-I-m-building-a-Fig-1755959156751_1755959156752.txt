Unified Prompt for Replit Agent – Figma-like Design Tool

Hello Replit Agent 👋,

I’m building a Figma-like design tool and here’s a clear breakdown of issues, feature requests, and QA testing expectations. Please read carefully and implement accordingly.

🐞 1. Current Issues & Bugs to Fix

Deselecting Tools

Once I select a tool (rectangle, circle, text, etc.), I cannot deselect it.

✅ Expected: Click on empty canvas or press Esc should deselect.

Eraser Tool Not Working

The eraser tool is visible but does nothing.

✅ Expected: Should erase paths, drawings, or selected objects.

Textbox Issue

Textbox appears but I cannot type inside.

✅ Expected: Able to type, edit, and format text.

Components & Layers Panel Visibility

Currently visible only on hover.

✅ Expected: Panels should stay permanently visible unless manually collapsed.

Layers Panel Missing Functions

Lacks proper Figma-style features.

✅ Expected: Show all layers, allow rename, drag to reorder, toggle visibility (eye), lock/unlock.

🔹 Bonus Futuristic Ideas: Gesture editing, cross-app sync (Notion/Jira/Trello), auto-generated design docs, AI bug detector.

✅ 4. QA / Testing Checklist

After implementation, test with the following criteria:

Tool Selection & Deselect

Select a tool → draw → click empty space / Esc → deselect.

Eraser

Erase full/partial shapes.

Textbox

Insert → type → edit → format text.

Components & Layers

Always visible unless collapsed.

Show each shape as a layer.

Reorder, rename, lock/unlock, toggle visibility.

Shortcuts

All shortcuts work as listed above.

Canvas & Zoom

Scroll zoom, reset zoom, snap-to-grid.

Tool Behaviors

Rounded rectangles, Bezier pen curves, color picker works.

Image Upload

Upload works for PNG/JPG/SVG.

Resize, rotate, opacity, crop, replace.

🎯 Deliverable

Please:

Fix the bugs.

Add all feature requests + image upload.

Implement new AI-powered features (if possible, iterative build is fine).

Validate with the QA checklist before delivery.

👉 This will bring the tool very close to Figma, while also introducing next-gen AI/AR features that even Figma should consider adopting.
