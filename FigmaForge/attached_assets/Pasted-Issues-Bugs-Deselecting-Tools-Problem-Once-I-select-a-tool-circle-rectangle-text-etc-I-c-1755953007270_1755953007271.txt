Issues & Bugs

Deselecting Tools

Problem: Once I select a tool (circle, rectangle, text, etc.), I cannot deselect it.

Expected: Clicking on empty canvas area or pressing Esc should deselect the tool.

Eraser Tool Not Working

Problem: The eraser is visible but does not erase objects or drawings.

Expected: Eraser should remove selected shapes, freeform drawings, or lines.

Textbox Issue

Problem: Textbox appears on the canvas, but I cannot type inside it.

Expected: On double-clicking or selecting the text tool, I should be able to type, edit, and style text.

Components & Layers Panel Visibility

Problem: Panels only appear when I hover near them.

Expected: Panels should remain permanently visible, with manual collapse/expand option.

Layers Panel Functionality

Problem: Layers panel is incomplete.

Expected behavior (like Figma):

Show all elements in the canvas as a list of layers.

Drag & drop to reorder.

Rename layers.

Toggle visibility (eye icon).

Toggle lock/unlock (lock icon).
